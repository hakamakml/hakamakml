A tech enthusiast on a journey from **data-driven insights** to **secure and automated infrastructures**.

🎓 Graduated in Information Systems with a concentration in Business Intelligence at **Bina Nusantara University**

- 🔐 Now diving headfirst into the world of **Cybersecurity** and **DevOps**  
- 💡 Blending the mindset of a data analyst with the precision of a security engineer  
- 🛠️ Always tinkering, learning, and building — one script, one lab, one log file at a time

## 🚀 My Current Focus

Right now, I’m sharpening my skills in:

- 🔐 Threat detection & network monitoring (Security Onion, Zeek, Suricata)
- ☁️ Cloud security & endpoint protection (Microsoft Azure, Defender, Intune)
- ⚙️ DevOps automation & scripting (PowerShell, Bash, GitHub Actions)
- 📊 And still grounded in data — from SQL queries to Power BI dashboards

I believe that **security and automation** are the backbone of any resilient system —  
and that **data** is the compass that helps guide those systems forward.
